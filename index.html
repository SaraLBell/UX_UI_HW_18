         <div class="aboutMe">
                <p>I’m a passionate user-centric visual designer with a background in graphic design and digital marketing.  My goal is to craft inspiring solutions that drive thriving results, benefiting both end users and stakeholders.<br> <br> <br>

                    I love the process of creative collaboration, but I also value my creative alone time listening to Frank Sinatra. If you set a challenge in front of me, my competitive nature will shine and I become my own biggest competition.<br> <br> <br>
         
                    My dad is the reason the creative world is my passion, because it's his as well. This line of work didn't come naturally though. I was once told that "there is no prodigy in design. You have to be willing to learn it, to know it." and isn't that the truth. I am a full believer that if you have a passion, you are capable of inspiring the world around you.<br> <br> <br>
                    
                    I'm a FL girl deep down, but my soul is adventurous. I went to my dream college in GA, moved to SC, and now you can find me in Chicago, IL.<br> <br> <br>
                    ​
                    In my free time you can catch me outside with my little family (if the weather is acceptable) or unapologetically binging HGTV competition shows.<br> <br> <br>
                    
                    
                    Fun Facts: My walk out song would be Don’t Stop Me Now by Queen, favorite color is black, and I’ve rebuild a car engine before</p>
